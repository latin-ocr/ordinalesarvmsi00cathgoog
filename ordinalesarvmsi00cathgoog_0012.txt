PREFACE.

T is eighteen years ago since HENRY BRADSHAW expressed

Ι to me his wish to see an ‘⁴ ordinale Series.”
It was to contain “the various developments of the

Sarum Ordinale, from the Tractatus of Richard Poore, and
the Ordinale mentioned therein, if it can now be found, and
Maydeston‚ and the Dcy‘ensorr'um and Crede milri, with some-
thing introductory to show the real pedigree of the whole
thing.”

He added that he was “sure it could be done very satis-
factorily3 but some research has yet to be made, before know·
ledge sufficient lor such a book can be gained.”

At the time l looked lorward to doing the drudgery ol
at least certain sections ol such a volume as'he contemplated,
and l did not despair of getting the introduction from his
own pen or pencil; for he was so indulgent as to have let
me force him to write it even as he lay in bed; and he would
say, “give me no peace till I have done it.’‘· But it was not
tobe; and he passed to his well earned rest on the night of
February 1oth-11th, 1886, as he sat at his table, with the
bibliography ol the Sarum Brevt‘ary almost finishcd.

ln the course os succeeding years, the Society which bears
his name has brought out the Desensorr’um and Crede mr'lzi,
in 18943 and I have been engaged for six of the intervening
years upon another piece of work in which he took great
interest, and one section of which he had left virtually com-
plete, the Lincoln cathedra! Statutes.

Last year saw the re·issue in a scholarly form of the
T ructatus ol Richard Poore, edited by one of our Council,
Mr. Frere, and published by the Cambridge University Press
