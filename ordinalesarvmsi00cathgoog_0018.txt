PREFACE.

of the Sundays in the margin, and to continue the notes which
he had not carried beyond the first section. These will be
printed at the end of the second volume. The various readings
have been carefully revised and verihed by Mr. Henry Little·

some sections transcribed by Miss Α. F. Parker at the Bodleian.
I have received some help, as heretosore, from Dr. Legg and
