viii PREFACE.

under the title of “Tne Use' ns Sarum, Part 1, the Sarum
Customs, as set forth in the Consuetudinem and Custumary.''

Mr. Frere has now in the press a companion volume, which
will give the text of the old “ Ordinale Sarum,'’ from the
manuscripts.

These volumes will go very far to supply the knowledge
which rvas wanting a few years ag0.

“ Maydeston'' also will be in the hands of our Society, so
soon as the second volume of the “Directortitm Sacerdotem ’'

is complete; and the present volume is the first instalment ⁵

of that work.¹

This “Drnacnonrun Sacranoonun, (liber, quem ‘Pica
SARUM' vulgo vocziatclerns),” which gives us the text of Clement
Maydeston's work, as it had been printed by Caxton in 1487,
and again in 1489, reprinted by Gerard Leeu in 1488, and
again by Wynken de Worde “in domo Caxt0n” ins1495 in the
manner shown in our text. was revised by Master William
Clerke (like Bradshaw, aCambridge Kingsman) in 1497 ; and
six other editions followed down to* 1508,² in such a manner
as to suit the observance of the Corpus Christi festival with
an octave cum regimine cltori. Such variations as Clerke
introduced in 1497 will be found indicated in our notes marked
’97, '01, and '08 (tie, from the editions printed by Richard
Pynson in 1497, 1501, and 1508, respectively), and occur
mainly in the notes to such passages as are printed at pp. 41,
42; 593 86, 873 101, etc. (See also p. 170,n.) But the eye
will be more quickly attracted by such places as pp. 105-7,
178-9, 252-3, and 327-8, where the earlier editions of
1487-8 treated of a condition of things which existed in the
month of August before the nova festa of the Transfigura-

¹ The text of 1495 is here adopted as our authority. The few passages in which
the earlier editions differ are indicated faithfutly in our font-notes by Mt. Henry
Littlehnles. ’

² In 1509 W. Clerke died, und in the same year a shorter recension began to be ⁹

incorporated in the Samni Brevem.
