Beyond my expectation, the drudgery of transcription was
entirely taken out of my handS, through the kind enthusiasm
of our revered first Chairman of Council os the Henry Bradshaw
Society, the Reverend WILLIAM COOKE, MA. (Cambridge),
F.S.A., Honorary Canon os Chester, and Examining Chaplain
tu Bp. Graham of Chester.

As 1 lived at a considerable distance l'rom London, and the
first part ol the original copy of W. de Worde’s Pica of 1495,
which Mr. F. H. Dickinson had given me, was defective,
Canon Cooke began (about 1892) to transcribe at the British
Museum, and became so deeply interested in the work, that
he never stopped (except when illness interrupted him) until
the whole was finished. He was, ol course, able to borrow
my copy; but beyond frequent correspondence, and an occa·
sional delightful visit to him at 6, Clifton·place, Sussex Square,
when we discussed the work, Ι had little to do with the labours
os transcripti0n; and 1 was entirely relieved of all burden
until aster his lamented death, on Nov. 23rd, 1894.

He had collated the other editions at the British Museum,
and by the assistance ol Mr. F. Jenkinson, Bradshaw’s successor
at Cambridge, and os Bradshaw’s expert amanuensis, Mr.
Alfred Rogers, he had procured an accurate transcript ol' the
whole ol Gerard Lceu‘s edition of 1488. Ihave endeavoured
to carry out Canon Cooke's method of editing, excepting in
some small details as to expansions of abbreviations or con-
tractionS, and the use os capital letters, wherein l have been
guided by the experience and advice of scholars, whom Canon
Cooke consulted, I have had todo no more than to correct the
