Canon Cooke will be long remembered as the donor of his
splendid and choice library oi five thousand rare, valuable, and
usesul patristic, liturgical, and other works, to the library oi

Selwyn College, Cambridge. The arrangement, the supervision
oi the binding, and the actual cataloguing of this collection was
a work os love to him in his later years; and we may hope that
thosewho are privileged to use the volumes may catch some of
the generous and loyal spirit of the donor.

Since his death, Miss Haggitt has edited from his papers (for
private circulation) ‘T lee College er Cleantey os Denston' in
Suffotk (Murray), 1898, pp. 72.
