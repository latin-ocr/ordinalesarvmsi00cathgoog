ΟΝ MSS. OF THE “DIRECTORIVW xix

are found in other uses. Thus Haenel mentions, at Rouen
(MS. 247) Directorium per totum annum. And at St Gall
(MSS. 532-8) seven volumes written in the sixteenth century.
One, by Fridolinus Sicher containing two sections, and the
other consisting (like the York Pye) of 36.

ln an appendix to the T racts of Clamant Maydeston (pp. 119

solt), 1 gave some sections from T. Raynton's manuscript, last
mentioned, the Regula de lustoriis inchoandis or Pye ior three
commemorations; and for its presace I gave a reference to the
parallel passage in the reprinted Sarum Brevian'um (ccclxxvii-

viii, cantabr. 1882).

It seems worthy of observation that the late fisteenth century
Praemonstratensian Ordinal now at Jesus College, Cambridge
(MS. 55 ; R.G. 7) as described in Dr. M. R James’s Descriptive
Catalogne (Cambr. 1895, p. 87) opens with the same presace,
which, like Raynton’s, speaks os “ sex partes,’' where the printed
Sarum book says “ quinque ”3 but it agrees on the other hand
with the Breviary in the readings, “intrate in regulam sequentem,'’
and, “Quibus inuentis, operamini,'' as against Raynton's MS.
where we find the expressions, ‘⁴ accipite regulam „sequentem”
and “seruate modum regule illius.
