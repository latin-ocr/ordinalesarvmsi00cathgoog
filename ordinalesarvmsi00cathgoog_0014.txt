tion, and the Most Holy Name 01 Jesus had come into use,
and the introduction 01 these festivals called lor a revision 01
Clement Maydeston's book.

Soon alter our 50011111 was formed,l learnt that the Rev.
Jonn· 1101111111 Lunn, B.D., had transcribed the textos the
Dircctorium, or Pye, 11001 Pynson's edition of 1501. Ηο
kindly consented to put his copy at our disposal, and greatly
added to its value by annotating it on the opposite pages,¹
and hy writing some introductory explanations, in addition
to some earlier elucidations which he had written 101 me
while Henry Bradshaw was still alive, and while 1 was engaged
upon a shorter Pye or Ordritale 01 the Breviary. Fourth
Wrangler at Cambridge in 1853, Fellow 01 St John's College,
and in 1857-64 Sadlerian Lecturer,² Μ1. Lunn had a genius
101 calculations, and habits 01 mathematica} accuracy, combined
withan acquaintance with epacts, golden numbers, and bis·
sextiles, scarcely less intimate than that 01 a De Morgan or
a Sir Harris Nicolas, while his interest 10 the mediaeval
kalendar was equal to that 01 0 Hampson 01 a Brady; so
that his death in 1899 has been a discouragement in my work
as editor aud annotator, and a loss to those who use this book.
At the same time we are fortunate in having a good many 01
his notes and papers, some of which are reserved 101 001
second volume.

The Paschal Table 01 Kalendars in the present volume is
derived 110111 his notes, and I can only take credit 101 the
sorm in which they are combined.

Mr. Lunn was born at Cleeve Prior, in Worcestershire, March

8th, 1831, and was educated at King Edward Vlth's School,

¹ 111. Lunn, with characteristic ingenuity, had made use 01 an enormous 10110
ledger which had originally been ruled 101 a policyboolr in his father's Fire lnsurance
Society. Many 01 his notes which he sent me were written on the baclr 01 answers
written by candidates whom he had examined.

² He was noted 101 the sets 01 hard questions propounded to the advauced
mathematicians 01 St. John’s in the college examinations at the end 01 the May term.
These problems were {amiliarly known ns “the Seven Detilr..”
