Or Tus 11111 “DIRECTORIUM SACERDOTUM.”

When we were speaking of the “ Τ racts os clement Maydeston ’¹
in 1894, we had occasion to observe (p. xxxi. n.) that the name
“ Crede Miclu''' was not confined to the little treatise with
which we were then concemed. Ι lind, in like manner, that
the title “Directon’um Sacerdotum '’ had been applied to several
other guides or manuals of a somewhat different description.
Thus Montiaucon (Bibliotheca Br‘bliotlrecarum, Parisiis, 1739,
t. i. p. 563) mentions as among the Ambras MSS. (No. 93)
in the Imperial Library at Vienna: ‘⁴ M. Joan. Aurbachii

Directonicm Sacerdotem? And Haenel mentions another
copy at Basel (L. iii. 10). Although that bibliographer does
not notice the title ‘Directorricm’ in his alphabetical index,
l notice in his pages several MSS. described as directon’a clzori.
Two at St. Gall (MSS. 446, 484) of the late fourteenth or

the fisteenth century. Three antient ones at Rheinau (MSS.
66, 75, 85) of the eleventh or twelith century.l

At Lincoln College, Oxsord, MS. 96 (art 4) is a twelsth
century MS. of about 30 leaves ol instructions for priests, drawn
from the Fathers and Councils, and called “Directorium sacer-
dotum, sive capitula plura de istis quibus instrui oportet sacer-
dotes,'’ &c

At New College, Oxsord, MS. 94 (art. 12) isa sourteenth
century MS. os four leaves (ff. 171—4), called “Directorium
Sacamum, quomodo iniungendum sit penitentibus.''

At Trinity College, Oxlord, MS. 7 (art 28) in a fisteenth
century MS. of five leaves (ff. 177-181), is another “Dirccton'um
Sacerdotumss’ sor the benefit of the unlearned.

In the British Museum, Harleian MS. 3378 is entitled
“Dircctorium Sacerdotum ad festos dies celebrandos.’'

ln later times 1 find mention of Dircctorium Sacerdotula
Matthiae Kinckii. 8ο Douai, 1631.
