Abp. Benson, Bp. Lightfoot‚ Canon Wickenden, Sir E. Burne-
Jones, and others. He removed to St. John’s College, Cambridge,
and obtained the distinction of being Fourth Wrangler in 1853,

Lunn's strong character that he denied himself the luxury of
having a pianoforte in his college rooms. For he was a born
musician, and had an acute and sensitive ear. Had he been
born in alater generation he would have ranked very high
among the iniant prodigies of recent times. Under his
mother's teaching he had been able to play from notes at the
phenornenal age of three years and six months. At five he had
performed at a village concert, and opened a small organ in
Cleeve Prior church. At fifteen he became organist ol Edgbas-
ton parish church, and on May 4th, 1847, Mendelssohn, who had
seen a specimen ol his transcription srom memory, wrote that
“ he must possess a very good ear sor music.'' For many years
he slept with Bach's 48 preludes and lugues in a neatly written
volume (“ Lunn's bible '') under his pillow

He was a leading member of the “Old University Musical
Society,'’ and of the “ Fitzwilliam Society‚’' at Cambridge; and
after he became vicar of Marton with Graston, Yorkshire, in the
diocese of Ripon‚ where he remained sor thirty-six years, until
his death, he acted as conductor at the Yorlc and Ripon festivals.

Mr. Lunn was a first-rate Mathematician,a splendid Musician,
no bad Classic, and an admirable Ecclesiastical Antiquary, an
enthusiastic rubber ol sepulchral brasses, and well read in
Theology.¹ Those who knew him best, describe him as
absolutely sincere and childlike, without any ol that sels-conceit
which sometimes makes the musician poor company for the less
gifted members of society. He was in many points “a walking
