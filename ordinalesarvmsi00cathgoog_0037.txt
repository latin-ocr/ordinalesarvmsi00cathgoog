PREFACE.

A Paschae Tanna or Kanauunns, with the Goauau
Nouanus and Enicas lor Oen and N sw Sarnus

*J This Table is an Index to the Kalendars comprised in
the “Directorium Sacerdotum,” and shows how they are to
be chosen according to the Golden Numbers and Epacts.

Thus if the Sunday letter be B, and the Golden Number
be iii, 4 B. will be the Kalendar in force for the year in question.

This System ol Golden Numbers in New Style continues ·

in force until the year MD. 2¹199: there is no Paschal Terrn on
March 21st, and consequently Easter is never on March 22nd,
ia, Kalendar 1. D. is never used in the present epoch.

After the year 2199, a shift os Golden Numbers takes place,
and the Nurnber6 gives the earliest Paschal Terrn on March
alst.

1. D. will therefore again become possible, and indeed will
be in use in the year 2285, is that year should ever corne.

The case os a Leap Year with Easter on April 25th is very
rare. lt happens, in Old Style, once in every 532 years. The
last instance was in A.D.1736. In New Style. the shists ol
Golden Nurnbers render it still more rare. 1t has not as yet
happened in New Style‚ nor will it occur'until au. 3784. At
Rome, therefore, such a case has not been experienced since
A.D.1204.
